                           <p>The Delta’s topography and geology – like deltas worldwide – make it not only a site of agricultural richness but of petroleum as well. The shallow shelf that protrudes from the mouth of the river into the ocean <u>allows rigs to access deeper reservoirs of oil</u> than they would otherwise, and the sediment deposited over millennia is associated with petroleum deposits. Tar and other hydrocarbons had been present in the landscape – used for sealing canoes and as insect repellent, but it wasn’t until 1911 that the first offshore rig in Louisiana was built in Caddo Lake, ten years after the gusher at Spindletop, Texas launched an oil boom in the region. In 1947 the first rig out of sight of land was installed in the Gulf of Mexico and the thousands of rigs that followed fed the United States’ growing energy demand after World War II. Refineries were built along the Gulf Coast beginning in 1909 to process not only the oil and gas from the region, but later also that transported in cross continental pipelines from oil fields thousands of miles away. The cluster of refineries birthed an equally large chemical industry. The Louisiana Governor John McKeithen <u>sought to draw industry to the region</u> in the 1960s by branding Louisiana as a “Right to Profit State,” <u>providing tacit support</u> for the decades-long fight against unions and the racial integration of the industry.

In the early twentieth century, African American laborers were coerced into building a system of levees to facilitate the transport of oil and stabilize land for pipelines, leading to dramatic land subsidence and wetland loss as well as restructuring the region’s hydrology in ways that would exacerbate catastrophic flooding.

                        <li><u>reducing and ultimately ending subsidies and tax credits for fossil fuel exploration, processing, distribution and marketing.</u> Fossil fuel companies receive $20 billion annually from state and federal governments, which encourages them to “drill, baby, drill” in ever riskier areas without fear of losing profit. This system of subsidies and lax enforcement is facilitated by the close relationship between fossil fuel companies and the politicians they support. According to Oil Change International, “in the 2015-2016 election cycle oil, gas, and coal companies <u>spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying </u> and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years - an 8,200% return on investment.” Louisiana alone has nine different subsidies for oil and gas, which combined removed $322 million annually from tax revenue. For comparison, <u>the 2019 budget for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources was $60 million</u> and <u>the 2018 budget for the Department of Economic Development was $44 million.</u></li>

                           <u>investing in physical and social health-supporting infrastructure.</u> The health impacts of living in proximity to fossil fuel infrastructure will last in the bodies and psyches of residents for generations. Measures to address this trauma will need to be on terms set by residents, but will likely include free and accessible health care, improved water treatment, home retrofits to address respiratory health triggers as well as the full remediation of toxic soils.

                           <u>transitioning fossil fuel workers to well-paid, unionized jobs in other sectors.</u> There are upwards of 100,000 workers in the fossil fuel sector in the Delta. These residents of the Delta – like all their neighbors – deserve to count on good jobs. Given the future need for remediation and decommissioning at former sites of fossil fuel extraction, processing, storage and distribution, this transition to new jobs shouldn’t be hard, but will require intention and follow-through, as well as some re-training. One of the keys to this will be working with unions, one of the most important expressions collective will. <u>As the Roosevelt Institute has proposed</u>, sectoral bargaining could help achieve this at scale, rather than trying to implement job transitions site-by-site.
