                <p>
                  Water is life in the Mississippi Delta, and sometimes also death. Constrained by levees the height of a 5-story building that both protect and threaten those on the other side, the Mississippi River drains water from about 41% of the United States, carrying with it the nutrients, barges and flotsam of faraway cities and fields. The flow of the river guides the gaze, making it natural to orient downriver, to assume the delta is defined by what it receives. The fertile land along the riverbanks and lush maze of the bayous echoes a similar story. But the delta has never been merely – or mainly – a terminus, it is more often a point of departure, a tap, a mine, a meandering corridor oriented towards many elsewhere. The wealth is embedded in the layers of topsoil, sediment and fossilized organic material trapped 2,000+ feet underneath the current river’s edge. This wealth also lives within the bodies and cultures of those who work and know the land; have surveyed, measured, and priced it, and themselves have been surveyed, measured, and priced. Their value to Delta’s farmland has been immeasurable, yet the region’s slaveholding planters and contemporary corporate landowners have held a monopoly control over the fruits of this labor and knowledge.
                  </p>
                  <h5>  
The worship and extraction of <b>land, labor and resources</b> in the Delta, even as their value is marginalized and cheapened, is one of the region’s many paradoxes; one that produces and re-produces violence and dispossession across the landscape at multiple scales.  
</h5>

<p>A corollary paradox is the role of technology in this land of many literal and figurative ‘backwaters’ – technology has always been integral for processes of extraction, beginning with enslaved people being treated as instruments to transform the rich soil of the Delta into financial riches for the class of planters who owned nearly all of the land and many of its people.

The term emerged among Greek writers around 600 BCE1 to describe the Nile River Delta, whose cyclical floods and millennia of agricultural abundance have very literally given shape to the global imagination of what and who deltas serve. Along the Mississippi River, the relation to water and empire are explicit in the town names that recall its North African cousin: Cairo, Illinois; Luxora, Arkansas; Thebes, Illinois; Egypt, Tennessee. They are/were places of plenty, buoyed by the meanders and floods of a river coursing through what became – through settler colonialism – the middle of the United States. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The letter Δ is also used in mathematics to denote change, a concept that resonates in a riverine landscape where water shapes land, labor, and resources, and is itself shaped by the land, labor, and resources of the cultures that bind a river and its community. Petroleum, people, cotton, sugar, music, benzene and plastic have made their exodus via the river in a constant stream, carving out channels to new markets, new buyers, new visions of profit, remaking the Mississippi and its people over and over again. You can never step in the same river twice.  </p>

                              <p>These goals are meant to honor and reflect the demands that grassroots and social movement groups in the Delta that have been imagining and building radical alternatives to the region’s extractive economy over decades and centuries. In this moment, we seek to follow the path set out by the coalition behind the <a href="https://f051d680-6bda-4883-b0d9-76edcc6ecdae.filesusr.com/ugd/6ac318_4a76df6a0cd949508798d3cbd66e3e62.pdf"> Gulf South for a Green New Deal</a>, <a href="https://m4bl.org/policy-platforms/reparations/"> Movement for Black Lives reparations platform </a>, the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/true-new-deal-for-the-covid-19-era/"> Roosevelt Institute’s True New Deal</a>, <a href="https://f051d680-6bda-4883-b0d9-76edcc6ecdae.filesusr.com/ugd/6ac318_4a76df6a0cd949508798d3cbd66e3e62.pdf">NAACP’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program Goals</a>, <a href="https://psequity.org/just-energy/">Partnership for Southern Equity’s Just Energy equity ecosystem</a> and many others.   
                              </p>
                              <p>These goals are intended to be abstract enough to guide action at all scales. In the spirit of Adrienne Marie Brown’s guide to emergent strategy, they should be viewed as almost fractal-like, producing similar structures and frameworks for interaction at the scale of a single site design or a Congressional budgeting session. This nested model allows for action at a variety of scales—a kind of intra- and inter-regional operability that’s necessary to build a just, democratic Green New Deal. A site design is not meaningful without the congressional budget appropriation that promises to make it a reality; nor is the closure of a federal prison facility as meaningful if it’s accompanied by an expanded state prison-building program. The national policy shifts called for in HR 109 and the True New Deal2 are in many cases ideal preconditions for the Delta-specific program outlined below. This relationship is not linear or one-directional, however; a holistic approach to meeting these goals at the regional level will create a larger and more vocal constituency for national policy and funding changes, just as national funding, assistance and enforcement would help activate a local constituency to lead and support implementation efforts. Ultimately, our vision is one of agency—for the people of the Delta to wield the power and resources they need to build the kinds of futures they’ve been organizing around for generations.

                              <p>Using these three goals as framing devices, below we have traced out the potential shape of a new delta, leaning on all definitions of the word. A delta that embraces change, one that orients both upstream and downstream, one that leans into the strength of its triangular shape, imagining land, labor and resources as the three inseparable sides of a Green New Deal for the region.

European colonizers enacted sequential waves of genocide that reduced the number of native people in the region five-fold from 1492 to 1692. What the Spanish and French started, Thomas Jefferson continued and Andrew Jackson finished through the Indian Removal Act of 1830 where ancestral Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek and Choctaw lands were violently appropriated for cotton, and surviving tribal members were forced to walk to lands in Oklahoma along the infamous and deadly Trail of Tears.

Through sheer force of will, Black landowners steadily increased their share of land in the beginning of the 20th century, but never attained ownership rates proportional with population composition. Social, political, economic, and legal obstacles persisted and by mid-century black landownership rates declined again in a period some refer to as the Great Dispossession. In fact, the combination of federal agricultural policy and corporate landowners resulted in land loss for small farmers of all races. In essence, “large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed.”

                           Very real physical, economic and psychological harms have been wrought by the systems of extraction described above. White USDA farm insurance brokers pushed Black farm owners into bankruptcy; multinational petrochemical corporations took years of healthy living from residents of Cancer Alley; racist juries and sentencing guidelines put Black people behind bars for decades. The layers of dispossession and trauma call for a multi-decade investment in care and healing for the people and places who have endured the direct and indirect effects of this exploitation. It follows that healing requires 1) an end to ongoing processes that continue to cause harm and 2) reparative measures on terms set by those who have experienced harm.

                        <li><u>restructuring the land inheritance system. </u> In order to reverse Black land loss and enable a more robust effort towards reparations, States must pass the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, which allows farmers and their heirs who lack clear title to their land to get title without risking that the property will be put up for auction. Clear titles to farmland enable the owners to access a range of USDA loan options, which have historically been withheld from Black farmers using unclear titles as an excuse.</li>
                        <li><u>environmental regeneration.</u> The levees surrounding the Mississippi River have created an environment that denies water its central role. Environmental degradation, stronger storms, and deteriorating infrastructure make this system untenable, but like the Green New Deal as a whole, there is an opportunity to address multiple problems with elegant solutions in the overly constrained riverine landscape. Encouraging the use of flood resistant crops like wetland agriculture (paludiculture), expanding the floodplain through buyouts and easements to make “room for the river,” and increasing the prevalence of aquaculture create sustainable ways to live with the water, rather than attempt to remove and control it. </li>

                           Addressing climate change and dismantling extractive industries in the Delta will require collaboration and relationships. A legal, economic and social frame that lifts up individual needs at the expense of the collective no longer works.  Given that residents of the Delta have been organizing themselves and establishing systems of mutual aid for generations, it is clear that most people don’t want to go it alone when they have the option of operating in community with others. The public sector should recognize the need for collaborative and collectivist approaches and incentivize them where possible.

                        <li><u>collective ownership, both as a legal frame and a cultural frame.</u> In a twist of the “back to the land” campaign, we call for a “land back” movement where land is given back to the people as opposed to people returning to the land. Land taken from corporate landowners that have exploited and destroyed it for decades must be reallocated to farmworkers and governed in collective ownership. As a revival of the New Deal model of transforming former plantations to cooperatively-owned farms, corporate industrial farms will be transfigured into communal enterprises. Land ownership is power and land ownership provides freedom, so shifting control to those who have worked it will empower and transform the livelihoods of the masses in the Delta. </li>
                        <li><u>establishing a network of regenerative farms.</u> Transitioning from the current industrially-powered monocultural farming practices to more sustainable, regenerative methods will require and benefit from the formation of a network of farms in collective ownership. Environmental health, social equality, and economic stability are the cornerstones of this network of regenerative farms. Knowledge and best practices of farming in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes destruction will be passed throughout the system to the mutual prosperity of its members. </li>

                        <p>The evolution of the carceral system within the Delta serves as a stark example of how exploitative practices reinvest themselves over time. The colonization of Native American land provided the necessary space to engineer a plantation-driven economy, culture, and rule of law. Generations later, this has created a carceral economy that has harmed the livelihood and prosperity of millions of households within the Delta. The region’s over-dependence on correctional related jobs, bloated police budgets, and perpetually high incarceration rates are key to understanding why a final transition from mass incarceration to restorative justice is necessary for the Delta.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following the abolition of slavery and immediate loss of labor, white powerbrokers conspired to establish the Convict Lease System: a deal in which wealthy landowners rented prisoners at extremely low wages to provide labor for their private development and farms. This program began in Louisiana in 1844 and remained a fixed feature of almost every southern economy and politic until the 1940’s.5 Despite widespread adoption, there was persistent condemnation ranging from literary observations like Mark Carlton’s <i>The Politics of the Convict Lease System in Louisiana </i>to grand jury reports in Mississippi which revealed disturbing details of hospitalized convicts whom were suffering starvation, disease, and brutality after working on farms and railroads. In fact, the report concluded that “God will never smile on a State that treats its convicts as Mississippi does.”

Ultimately, both states transitioned their largest plantations from Angola Farm and Parchman Farm, to the respective Louisiana and Mississippi State Penitentiary. The transition from enslaved to incarcerated people at the same facilities is emblematic of how white power structures reinvented systems of oppression through state legitimated programs.

Within the 17 largest metro areas in the Delta, police budgets command an average 24% of general operating budgets reaching as high as 43% in the city of Carbondale, Illinois and a total of $824 million across these jurisdictions. This issue becomes increasingly apparent when considering that each state in the Delta <u>spends a below average amount on education</u>, most <u>underinvest in health and hospital expenditures</u>, and have six of our eight states have minimum wages equivalent to the federal minimum of $7.25/hour. Grassroots organizations like the Orleans Parish Prison Coalition Reform have advocated against increasing expenditures within the New Orleans carceral system by <u>pressuring legislators to lower the personal jail cap</u>, halt the construction of a prison addition, and find a permanent solution to treating the city’s mentally ill population. While the ultimate vision is to engineer the complete closure of American prisons facilities, organizations like OPPC provide a model for communities across the Delta to take incremental steps towards reducing prison capacity, police budgets, and the ability for legislators to street greater capital into the carceral system.</li>

                        <li><u>defunding and disbanding the police, and investing in communities.</u> State and local budgets are increasingly drained by expansive police budgets that increase nearly every year. Within the 17 largest metro areas in the Delta, police budgets command an average 24% of general operating budgets reaching as high as 43% in the city of Carbondale, Illinois and a total of $824 million across these jurisdictions. This issue becomes increasingly apparent when considering that each state in the Delta <u>spends a below average amount on education</u>, most <u>underinvest in health and hospital expenditures</u>, and have six of our eight states have minimum wages equivalent to the federal minimum of $7.25/hour. Grassroots organizations like the Orleans Parish Prison Coalition Reform have advocated against increasing expenditures within the New Orleans carceral system by <u>pressuring legislators to lower the personal jail cap</u>, halt the construction of a prison addition, and find a permanent solution to treating the city’s mentally ill population. While the ultimate vision is to engineer the complete closure of American prisons facilities, organizations like OPPC provide a model for communities across the Delta to take incremental steps towards reducing prison capacity, police budgets, and the ability for legislators to street greater capital into the carceral system.</li>

                           <p>The Delta’s topography and geology – like deltas worldwide – make it not only a site of agricultural richness but of petroleum as well. The shallow shelf that protrudes from the mouth of the river into the ocean <u>allows rigs to access deeper reservoirs of oil</u> than they would otherwise, and the sediment deposited over millennia is associated with petroleum deposits. Tar and other hydrocarbons had been present in the landscape – used for sealing canoes and as insect repellent, but it wasn’t until 1911 that the first offshore rig in Louisiana was built in Caddo Lake, ten years after the gusher at Spindletop, Texas launched an oil boom in the region. In 1947 the first rig out of sight of land was installed in the Gulf of Mexico and the thousands of rigs that followed fed the United States’ growing energy demand after World War II. Refineries were built along the Gulf Coast beginning in 1909 to process not only the oil and gas from the region, but later also that transported in cross continental pipelines from oil fields thousands of miles away. The cluster of refineries birthed an equally large chemical industry. The Louisiana Governor John McKeithen <u>sought to draw industry to the region</u> in the 1960s by branding Louisiana as a “Right to Profit State,” <u>providing tacit support</u> for the decades-long fight against unions and the racial integration of the industry.

                        <li><u>reducing and ultimately ending subsidies and tax credits for fossil fuel exploration, processing, distribution and marketing.</u> Fossil fuel companies receive $20 billion annually from state and federal governments, which encourages them to “drill, baby, drill” in ever riskier areas without fear of losing profit. This system of subsidies and lax enforcement is facilitated by the close relationship between fossil fuel companies and the politicians they support. According to Oil Change International, “in the 2015-2016 election cycle oil, gas, and coal companies <u>spent $354 million in campaign contributions and lobbying </u> and received $29.4 billion in federal subsidies in total over those same years - an 8,200% return on investment.” Louisiana alone has nine different subsidies for oil and gas, which combined removed $322 million annually from tax revenue. For comparison, <u>the 2019 budget for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources was $60 million</u> and <u>the 2018 budget for the Department of Economic Development was $44 million.</u></li>

                           <u>transitioning fossil fuel workers to well-paid, unionized jobs in other sectors.</u> There are upwards of 100,000 workers in the fossil fuel sector in the Delta. These residents of the Delta – like all their neighbors – deserve to count on good jobs. Given the future need for remediation and decommissioning at former sites of fossil fuel extraction, processing, storage and distribution, this transition to new jobs shouldn’t be hard, but will require intention and follow-through, as well as some re-training. One of the keys to this will be working with unions, one of the most important expressions collective will. <u>As the Roosevelt Institute has proposed</u>, sectoral bargaining could help achieve this at scale, rather than trying to implement job transitions site-by-site.
