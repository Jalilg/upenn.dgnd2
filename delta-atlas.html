Constrained by levees the height of a 5-story building that both protect and threaten those on the other side, the Mississippi River drains water from about 41% of the United States, carrying with it the nutrients, barges and flotsam of faraway cities and fields. The flow of the river guides the gaze, making it natural to orient downriver, to assume the delta is defined by what it receives. The fertile land along the riverbanks and lush maze of the bayous echoes a similar story. But the delta has never been merely – or mainly – a terminus, it is more often a point of departure, a tap, a mine, a meandering corridor oriented towards many elsewhere. The wealth is embedded in the layers of topsoil, sediment and fossilized organic material trapped 2,000+ feet underneath the current river’s edge. This wealth also lives within the bodies and cultures of those who work and know the land; have surveyed, measured, and priced it, and themselves have been surveyed, measured, and priced. Their value to Delta’s farmland has been immeasurable, yet the region’s slaveholding planters and contemporary corporate landowners have held a monopoly control over the fruits of this labor and knowledge.

                        <p >River deltas are so named because of their triangular shape, which recalls the shape of the Greek letter Δ. The term emerged among Greek writers around 600 BCE1 to describe the Nile River Delta, whose cyclical floods and millennia of agricultural abundance have very literally given shape to the global imagination of what and who deltas serve.
